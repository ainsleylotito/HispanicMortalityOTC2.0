# Mortality Data 
## 1999-2013 
```{r}
mortality99_13 <- read.csv("../RawData/2021-05-14_deaths_final_1999_2013_county_year_sup.csv")
```

First, we need to restrict the dataset to only observations with CA residents. We will do so by restricting the data to only cases where the `Geography_Type` column is "Residence", as per the data dictionary definition: 

**Whether the geography is based on the place of residence or place of occurrence. A geography type of Residence includes events for California residents even if they occurred outside of California, whereas a geography type of Occurrence includes events that occurred within California even if they were not California residents.**

## 2014-2023
```{r}
mortality14_23 <- read.csv("RawData/20241220_deaths_final_2014_2023_county_year_sup.csv")
```
