## Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing Hispanic mortality trends among California residents.

## Data
- Mortality data (2007–2023) at the county-year level
- Population estimates each year by age, sex, race, and ethnicity (2007-2023)
### Data sources: 
- **California Department of Public Health (CDPH)**  
  County-level mortality data were obtained from the California Department of Public Health’s *Death Profiles by County* dataset. These data include annual counts of deaths stratified by demographic characteristics and cause of death and are publicly available through the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal.

- **California Department of Finance – Demographic Research Unit (DOF)**  
  County- and state-level population estimates were obtained from the California Department of Finance (DOF) Demographic Research Unit. Annual population estimates were used to calculate mortality rates and denominators for analysis. Estimates are based on the E-4 population series and benchmarked to decennial census counts where applicable.
